Image recognition to detect drowning lifeforms.

## brainstorm
- [ ] Recognise waves/water.
- [ ] Recognise rip currents.
- [ ] Recognise animate objects.
- [ ] Object leaves out the side; all good.
- [ ] Object lost in the middle, for t seconds (time as a parameter); human can check it, or just auto-call for help.
- [ ] Object gained in the middle; beached animals.
- [ ] Recognise hand/arm gestures (SOS waving vs friendly waving).
- [ ] Recognise struggling (frantic splashing vs energetic swimming).
- [ ] Recognise unconscious buoyant lifeforms.
